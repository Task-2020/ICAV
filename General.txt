5. Explain the concept of branching in Git.?

Branch in Git is similar to the branch of a tree. 
Analogically, a tree branch is attached to the central part of the tree called the trunk.
While branches can generate and fall off, 
the trunk remains compact and is the only part by which we can say the tree is alive and standing.
Similarly, a branch in Git is a way to keep developing and coding a new feature or 
modification to the software and still not affecting the main part of the project. 
We can also say that branches create another line of development in the project

6. What is a merge conflict in Git, and how can it be resolved?

A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
When all the changes in the code occur on different lines or in different files, 
Git will successfully merge commits without your help.However, when there are conflicting changes on the same lines,
 a “merge conflict” occurs because Git doesn’t know which code to keep and which to discard.
